"""Phase 5.2 — device handoff: unprompted speech follows the owner to his active device.

Before this, a proactive nudge / fired reminder was broadcast to EVERY connected client at once (or a
phone in a pocket). Handoff makes the brain track the device the owner last spoke to and deliver there,
falling back to a full broadcast only if that device has dropped (so reach is never reduced). This locks:
an utterance marks its device active, a nudge then targets only that device, a later utterance on another
device hands off, and a vanished active device falls back to everyone.
