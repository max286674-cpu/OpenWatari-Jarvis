"""Fix #4 — the self-improvement reviewer now feeds the L5b graph, and Fix #3 — L5 semantic is on.

Previously the entity-relation graph sat empty (nothing wrote to it) and semantic recall was off by
default. This verifies:
  * review_and_learn parses the new {"facts":[...], "relations":[...]} object, writes facts to L1 AND
    triples to the graph — in ONE model call — and still accepts the legacy bare-array form;
  * the populated graph answers multi-hop queries;
  * memory_semantic_enabled now defaults True (graceful — no embedder still degrades to keyword).

Hermetic: temp stores, a fake LLM. No network.
