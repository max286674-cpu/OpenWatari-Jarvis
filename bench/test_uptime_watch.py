"""Uptime watcher state machine (TODO #1 P2) — edge-triggered, no repeat alerts.

The whole value of the watcher is that it alerts EXACTLY ONCE when the brain goes down and EXACTLY
ONCE when it recovers — never spamming a message every tick during a long outage. This verifies that
edge-triggered logic. Pure, offline, no network.
