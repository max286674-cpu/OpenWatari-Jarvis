"""C4 hermetic test — streaming TTFW budget (no network).

The speed win that matters for a voice assistant is time-to-first-WORD: the owner should hear the first
spoken sentence while the rest is still generating, not after. With a stream whose tail is deliberately
slow, assert respond_stream emits the first sentence in a tiny fraction of the whole turn. Relative +
absolute guards (like test_failover_latency) so only a real regression trips it, not scheduling noise.

(The rest of C4 — fast-tier chain + first-token-deadline failover + tool turns routed to the reliable
caller — is already covered by test_llm_routing and test_intent_router; this fills the TTFW gap.)
