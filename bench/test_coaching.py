"""Phase 2 companion — field coaching (skill reviews, level, streak, trend) + the evening offer.

Proves Watari can coach the owner's focus fields (e.g. German): track his level, log 1-10 reviews,
keep a daily streak + trend, know when a field is due, and OFFER an evening review at his level
through the proactive engine (kind 'coaching', so Phase 1's context-gate + dismissal-learning apply).

Hermetic: temp SQLite, injected dates, config overrides. No network, no LLM.
