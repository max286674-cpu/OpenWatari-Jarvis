"""Phase 2.1 — the owner's world-model (durable goals/projects/deadlines + context).

Foundation for reasoned anticipation (2.3): the store the LLM reasons FORWARD from. Asserts upsert/
dedup, persistence across reload, deadline-ordered active goals, overdue/due-today rendering, status
transitions, and pruning of stale done goals. Hermetic — a temp file, an injected clock.
