"""Smoke test: real agent.respond_stream against the live proxy + new model.

Prints each spoken sentence as it arrives with a timestamp, so we can see time-to-first-sentence
(the latency the user actually feels) vs the old wait-for-the-whole-reply behaviour. Run:

    uv run python bench/smoke_stream.py
