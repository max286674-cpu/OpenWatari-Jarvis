"""G1 hermetic test — acknowledgement responses are varied and don't stack (no network).

Asserts the polish from G1:
  * a router-narrowed ZERO-ARG read suppresses the generic immediate ack (the specific per-tool ack
    "Checking your calendar, sir." lands in milliseconds — a generic "Right away" would just double up);
  * an arg-bearing command still gets an instant ack (real dead air during arg-extraction);
  * the immediate ack rotates — never the identical line twice in a row.
