"""LIVE end-to-end: Notion task queue + a reminder that fires NOW and is ANNOUNCED via the edge.

Exercises the real stack against the owner's live Notion + scheduler (uses .env creds):
  1. create a Notion task WITH a reminder ~8s out (reminder announced through the edge at fire time);
  2. confirm the task really landed in the Notion tasks DB (query it back);
  3. wait for the reminder to FIRE and assert it was SPOKEN through the edge speak callback;
  4. update the task (priority), then complete it (which cancels any pending reminder), then delete it;
  5. build the live daily digest and print it.

Phone push is mocked so this never spams the real phone; the spoken path is captured via a fake
edge callback (exactly how the brain server wires server.speak_reminder -> connected clients).
