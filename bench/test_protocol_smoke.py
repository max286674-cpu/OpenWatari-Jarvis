"""Protocol smoke + overlap audit (TODO 6 P1) — the recovery protocols are never drilled.

You reach for phoenix/ragnarok exactly when things are on fire, so a script that only breaks THEN is
the worst kind of latent bug. This drills all 8 protocols WITHOUT firing the destructive action:

  * every protocol script parses (valid Python — no syntax rot that surfaces only at 3am);
  * the recovery scripts contain the behaviour they claim (phoenix relaunches the edge, ragnarok
    reboots, goodnight terminates) — a structural check, not an execution;
  * the password gate holds and, with the RIGHT password, run_protocol launches the RIGHT script —
    with subprocess.Popen STUBBED so nothing is actually killed/rebooted;
  * OVERLAP AUDIT: the three archive protocols (backup / checkpoint / auditpack) target DISTINCT
    roots, so none is redundant.

Fully hermetic — no process is ever really terminated.
