"""C3 hermetic test — affect → ElevenLabs voice_settings map (no network).

The map is the tuning knob for mood-adaptive prosody. Assert valid ranges + the DIRECTION that matters:
stressed/low → steadier (higher stability) and not faster than neutral; upbeat → livelier (more style,
a touch quicker). Exact values are calibrated by ear (the 1 live listen-check), so we test properties.
