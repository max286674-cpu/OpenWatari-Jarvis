"""Behavioral verification — which memory layer engages, and WHEN, as the agent runs.

Unit tests prove each layer works in isolation; this proves the AGENT actually reaches for the right
layer at the right moment during real turns, and that every fix from this session is wired into the
live turn path:

  L0 working memory  -> carried into every turn's messages (rolling history).
  L1 learned facts   -> auto-injected (Fix #1) when the utterance is about a known topic; in the
                        startup digest; refreshed mid-session (Fix #2). Read on demand via `recall`.
  L2 journal         -> auto-injected when the utterance matches a recent journal entry.
  L3 vault + L5 sem  -> reached through the `recall` tool (fused across layers; semantic on, Fix #3).
  L5b graph          -> WRITTEN by consolidation (Fix #4); READ when the utterance is relational
                        (the 'graph' lazy tool group activates).
  Consolidation      -> background review fires on the cadence and writes facts + relations.
  Discipline         -> a trivial or off-topic turn injects NOTHING (stopword filter + semantic floor).

Hermetic: temp stores swapped for the singletons, a capturing/scripted fake LLM. No network.
