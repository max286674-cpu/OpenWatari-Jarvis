"""Latency regression guard (TODO A3 / item 11) — fail CI if the voice loop's latency budget drifts.

There is no mic in CI, so this can't measure a real TTFW. What it CAN do — and what actually catches
regressions — is guard the two things that deterministically blow the budget:

  1. **Config invariants.** The perceived TTFW is dominated by fixed knobs: Deepgram endpointing (the
     trailing silence before an utterance finalises), the LLM first-token timeout, and the TTFW
     target itself. If someone bumps endpointing to 2000ms or the first-token timeout to 30s, no
     amount of fast inference recovers a snappy turn. Assert each stays inside a sane ceiling.

  2. **A representative battery floor.** Feed a TTFW distribution that reflects the CURRENT pipeline
     (Deepgram + groq primary) through the same VAQI math the live meter uses, and assert the score
     and mean stay above a floor. A code change that, say, re-adds a blocking summary pass on every
     turn would push mean TTFW past target and trip this.

Pure computation + config read — offline, deterministic.
