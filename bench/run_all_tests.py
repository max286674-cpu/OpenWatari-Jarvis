"""One command to verify Jarvis works end-to-end.

    uv run python bench/run_all_tests.py

Runs every check in order and prints a single PASS/FAIL summary. Tests are tagged:

  [offline]  — deterministic, no network (config, VAD, barge-in, wake-word perf)
  [network]  — needs the freellmapi proxy reachable (Jarvis's brain LLM); reported as
               SKIP (not FAIL) if the proxy is unreachable, so an offline run still passes
  [gated]    — the OpenClaw fleet connect, intentionally blocked until a sanctioned path
               is enabled; reported as SKIP

Exit code is non-zero only if a runnable test actually fails.
