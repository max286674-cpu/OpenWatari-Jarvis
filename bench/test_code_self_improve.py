"""Code self-improvement (4.12) — bounded, opt-in, branch-only loop.

Proves the safety envelope with a scripted fake LLM (no network, no real edits):
  * OFF by default — a disarmed call is a no-op that says so, and creates no branch.
  * Branch-first — the orchestrator creates a fresh branch before any edit is allowed.
  * The loop can read/edit/test/commit locally (pre-authorised, confirm-gated tools run)…
  * …but push NEVER happens autonomously: git_push is absent from the tool set AND, if attempted,
    DEFERS (surfaces as 'needs your approval'), it is never executed.
  * Bounded — respects the step budget.
