"""Latency regression guard — a live budget assertion, not a measurement.

One WS round-trip to the configured brain ("What time is it?") must produce its FIRST streamed
sentence inside BUDGET_S. Typical is ~1s over the tailnet; the budget is deliberately generous so
only a real regression trips it (the freellmapi-proxy incident was 15.7s). Skips when no brain is
reachable, so the hermetic suite still runs anywhere; the VPS deploy gate runs it against the
live brain, which is the point.
