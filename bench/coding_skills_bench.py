"""Coding-skills benchmark for Watari's brain — run BEFORE arming self-improvement.

Self-improvement means Watari edits his own source. Before trusting that, we verify he can actually
reason about code across the three axes Vazghen named:

  A. FIND areas for architectural improvement (spot real flaws, rank by severity)
  B. IMPLEMENT something better (rewrite a weak function, with correct code)
  C. Invent a TOTALLY NEW solution that beats the naive one (design + tradeoffs)
  D. Do it SAFELY on his own repo (tests, reversible git, confirm-first) — self-awareness

Each challenge poses a self-contained question to his reasoning brain (the same LLM chain that powers
his coding), captures the full answer, and scores it against a rubric of things a competent engineer
MUST mention. The rubric is a floor, not a ceiling — the full answers are printed so a human can judge
depth. Network test: needs the LLM reachable.
