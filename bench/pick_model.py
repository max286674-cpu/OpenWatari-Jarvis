"""Pick the voice brain by REAL first-sentence latency under the full agent load.

The bare-prompt bench (old version) was misleading — gpt-oss-120b looked fast (0.6s) but under
the agent's ~1.8k-tok system prompt + 40 tool schemas it "thinks" for several seconds before the
first token. For voice the only metric that matters is time-to-first-SPOKEN-sentence. This runs
agent.respond_stream with each model forced as the sole chain entry and times it. Run:

    uv run python bench/pick_model.py
