"""Auto-route regression: the built-in Realtek headphone JACK must NOT masquerade as connected headphones.

Repro of the 2026-07-24 -9999 outage: with AirPods gone, `prefer_private_output` grabbed
'Headphones 1 (Realtek HD Audio 2nd output with SST)' — an always-listed WDM-KS jack that fails to
open — instead of falling through to the OS default speakers.
