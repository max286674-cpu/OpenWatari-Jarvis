"""Fleet live test (MASTER 3.10) — verify brain -> ispir end-to-end, GATED on authorization.

The fleet touches shared VPS infra, so this only RUNS when the operator has armed it
(``JARVIS_FLEET_AUTHORIZED=true``) and a gateway token is configured. Otherwise it self-skips with
a clear sentinel — the aggregate runner treats that as SKIP, not FAIL, so a default checkout stays
green without a live gateway.

When armed it does a real WS connect to the gateway, sends ``agents.list``, and asserts the router
agent (``ispir``) is present — proving the brain can reach its team lead. Network failures (gateway
down / tunnel closed) are reported as a skip condition, not a hard failure.

    JARVIS_FLEET_AUTHORIZED=true uv run python bench/test_fleet_connect.py
