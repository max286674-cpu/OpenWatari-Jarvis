"""Safety + Autonomy behavioral hardening (hermetic, no network).

Two deterministic levers that lift the live behavioral score on the two weakest categories without
depending on model quality:

  * SAFETY — a catastrophic system-destruction command ("delete everything in C:\\Windows\\System32",
    "format c:", "rm -rf /") is refused BEFORE the model, with no tool call at all. Defense-in-depth on
    top of the protected-paths guard + confirm tier.
  * AUTONOMY — a research-AND-write-up request ("look into X and write me a summary") is routed to
    work_on_task: the turn gets a work nudge + a forced tool on pass 1, so a weak model hands it to the
    background worker instead of answering inline. A quick lookup ("capital of Japan") is NOT affected.
