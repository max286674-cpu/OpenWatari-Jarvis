"""Streaming-latency guard: a pure-chatter turn carries NO tool surface (so the model answers without
the ~10k-token, ~1.7s tool-schema prefill), while any tool-needing turn keeps its tools.

The detector must be HIGH-PRECISION: a false positive strips tools from a turn that needed one. So the
key assertions are the negatives — tool/knowledge/command turns must NOT be classified as pure chat.
