"""Screenshot transport fix — capture on the laptop, READ on the brain (works across the VPS split).

The old path captured on the laptop but OCR'd on the brain host, so on the 24/7 VPS the image never
existed where it was read. The fix: the `screenshot` PC op returns the image BYTES (base64) from the
machine with the display; the brain decodes + writes them brain-side, so read_screen_text can OCR it.

Hermetic: the capture op is monkeypatched to return a known image, so no real screen / AV / laptop.
