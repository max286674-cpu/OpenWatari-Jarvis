"""Voice-grade brain behaviour — Phase 2.3 / 2.4 / 2.5 (hermetic, no network).

Verifies the latency/correctness work that makes the brain voice-grade:

  * 2.3 single-tool short-circuit — a turn that calls exactly ONE speakable read-only tool speaks
    the tool result directly and SKIPS the second "summarise" LLM pass (one round trip saved).
  * 2.4 force tools for data-read intents — weather/price/email/calendar/tasks/web/vault questions
    are recognised as data reads (so the first pass forces a tool call, not a fabricated claim),
    while opinion/chat/arithmetic still answer freely.
  * 2.5 parallel independent tool calls — several tool calls in one model turn run concurrently
    (finish in max-latency, not the sum), while results stay in call order and confirm-gated tools
    are never run in this fast path.
