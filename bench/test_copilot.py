"""Phase 3 companion — the task co-pilot (clarify -> plan -> confirm -> execute -> report).

Proves Watari can PLAN a task with the owner (a dry-run: steps + clarifying questions + who does it +
which steps need approval) and then EXECUTE it in the background via the bounded worker or the fleet,
linking progress back to the to-do — while the defer-outward invariant stays sacred and auto-pilot is
opt-in. Hermetic: fake LLMs, a temp SQLite task queue, no network, no real fleet.
