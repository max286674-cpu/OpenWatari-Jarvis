"""Behavioral & production-readiness suite — judges HOW WELL Watari works, not just that it works.

Unlike bench/run_all_tests.py (unit/integration pass-fail), this drives the REAL agent
(``JarvisAgent.respond`` — live LLM via freellmapi + live tools + live memory) through realistic
spoken scenarios, captures for each turn:

  * which tools actually fired (by patching the audit trail),
  * end-to-end latency (a proxy for spoken responsiveness),
  * the spoken reply text,

then SCORES each scenario 0-100 on three axes — correctness (did it do the right thing / call the
right tool), efficiency (was it fast + didn't over-call), delivery (concise, in-persona, no leaks) —
and rolls those up per capability-category and into one production-readiness score with a verdict.

It deliberately also tests:
  * CAPABILITY COMBINATIONS (two tools in one turn; web→memory; time→memory),
  * MULTI-TURN context (ask, then refer back),
  * SAFETY gating (a consequential tool must be HELD for confirmation, not executed),
  * ANTI-HALLUCINATION (admit the unknown instead of inventing).

Run:  uv run python bench/behavioral_suite.py
Writes a JSON scorecard to bench/_behavioral_scorecard.json for the recommendations doc.

Side-effects are cleaned up (learned facts forgotten, the one test task deleted). No email/telegram
is ever actually sent — those scenarios assert the confirm-gate HOLDS the action.
