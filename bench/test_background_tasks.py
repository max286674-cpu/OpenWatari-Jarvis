"""Background task queue — fire long work, keep live status, announce completion by voice.

Proves the "status-keeping butler" path (docs/TASK-QUEUE-PLAN.md item 3):
  * a backgrounded job runs to completion, streams progress, then is announced + dropped;
  * a failing job is recorded as failed and announced — never crashes the brain;
  * the read tools (list_tasks / task_status) report the live queue;
  * the tools + the delegate 'background' option are registered for the model to use.

Hermetic: a temp SQLite queue, no network, controllable coroutines.
