"""Phase 4.4 — delegation fast-path circuit breaker, hermetic.

Some gateways refuse WS operator connects over a non-secure context
(CONTROL_UI_DEVICE_IDENTITY_REQUIRED — they want HTTPS or localhost). When that happens the handshake
fails on EVERY delegation and we pay a doomed round-trip before the CLI answers. This locks the breaker:
first failure falls back and trips it, later calls skip WS entirely, and it self-heals on expiry/success.
