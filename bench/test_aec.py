"""Phase 1.2 — the AEC seam: open-speaker full-duplex when a real echo-canceller is active.

The working canceller (Krisp/ai-coustics) is a proprietary SDK we can't bundle, so this locks the parts
that ARE ours: the filter builder degrades cleanly when the SDK isn't installed (never crashes the edge),
noise-only names are refused, and — the actual integration — ``resolve_barge_in`` flips OPEN speakers to
full-duplex exactly when an echo-canceller is on the mic, while leaving every other case unchanged.
