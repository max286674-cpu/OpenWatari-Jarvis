.SYNOPSIS
    Cleanly restart Watari's laptop edge (pc_agent + voice assistant), force-killing stale instances.

.DESCRIPTION
    The edge runs as two Scheduled Tasks:
        WatariPcAgent  -> pythonw -m jarvis.edge.pc_agent   (RunLevel Highest / ELEVATED)
        JarvisEdge     -> pythonw -m jarvis.edge.assistant  (RunLevel Limited)

    IMPORTANT lesson (why this script self-elevates): `Stop-ScheduledTask` does NOT reliably terminate
    the pc_agent PROCESS — it's ELEVATED and, once running since logon, a non-elevated stop just bounces
    its WebSocket while the old process keeps executing OLD code. That left a stale pc_agent serving the
    brain and spawning PowerShell windows even after a code fix. So this script relaunches itself as
    admin and FORCE-KILLS every pythonw (and any orphaned activity-snapshot PowerShell) before starting
    the tasks fresh — guaranteeing a single, current-code instance.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\restart_edge.ps1
    (Approve the one UAC prompt.)

# 1. Stop the tasks (best effort) so the scheduler doesn't fight the kill.

# 2. FORCE-KILL the edge python processes. Now that we're elevated their command lines + exe paths are
#    readable, so we target PRECISELY: our own .venv interpreter, or any python whose command line is
#    a jarvis.edge module (covers a system-python child too). We do NOT kill by a null/blank command
#    line — that would catch unrelated pythonw apps.
#
#    Any PowerShell they spawned is killed by PARENT (a child of an edge python), never by matching a
#    command-line STRING: that string-match is what falsely flagged this very script's own monitoring
#    commands (their command line literally contains the search terms). Parent-based is immune to that
#    and can't hit an unrelated user PowerShell. (Note: activity_snapshot is pure ctypes now and spawns
#    nothing — this stays only to sweep up legacy orphans.)
