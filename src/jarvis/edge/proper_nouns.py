"""Phase 1.5 — proper-noun biasing for STT.

"Yerevan" became "your event" on every engine because the recogniser has no idea those words matter
to this owner. The fix is to hand the STT a small vocabulary of the names/places/projects it should
favour. This module builds that list — automatically from who the assistant is (its own name, the
owner's name + form of address) and the owner's contacts, plus anything configured in
``JARVIS_STT_HOTWORDS`` — and the STT builders pass it to the engine (Whisper ``hotwords=``, Deepgram
nova-3 ``keyterm=``). Biasing at the source beats guessing after the fact, so there's no risky
post-hoc fuzzy correction here.
