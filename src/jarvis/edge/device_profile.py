"""Smart output-device profiling → automatic barge-in decision.

Barge-in (interrupting Jarvis mid-sentence by speaking) is only safe when the mic CANNOT
re-hear Jarvis's own TTS. On open laptop/desktop speakers it can, so VAD would flag the
playback as "user speech" and Jarvis would interrupt himself — barge-in must stay OFF.
On a **private** endpoint (headphones / AirPods / earbuds / smart-glasses / a phone with
earbuds) the speaker is in/at your ear and the mic is isolated, so barge-in is safe and
should turn ON by itself.

This module is the identifier that decides that — automatically — from whatever endpoint is
actually in use, across devices:

  * Local PC: classify the resolved output device NAME (PyAudio) — Bluetooth/AirPods/headset
    → private; Realtek/internal/laptop speakers → shared.
  * Mentra glasses / iPhone / phone clients: the local device name says nothing about how YOU
    hear Jarvis, so the remote client DECLARES a hint ('glasses', 'phone-headphones',
    'phone-speaker', …) which we trust over name-sniffing.

Pure logic, no audio/pipeline deps, so it is unit-testable and reused by the edge builder.
