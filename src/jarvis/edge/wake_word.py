"""WakeWordGate — true always-listening, directed-only, multi-wake-word.

Audio is analysed **locally** by openWakeWord and is NOT forwarded to the (cloud) STT
until one of the owner's wake words is heard. After a wake, a listening window opens so a
command — and short follow-ups after Jarvis replies — flow through. The window closes on
silence, so ambient speech/media is ignored. Keeps Deepgram engaged only when addressed.

The owner's required wake set (see README): jarvis, alfred, robbin, assist, time to work,
wake up, six-one-nine. openWakeWord only ships pretrained models for a few phrases, so only
the resolvable ones load here; the rest are reported as pending (Porcupine path). The engine
is pluggable via ``JARVIS_WAKE_WORD_ENGINE``.

Placement: directly after ``transport.input()`` (before the echo gate and STT).
