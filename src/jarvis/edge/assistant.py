"""Phase 2 — wake-word assistant with Jarvis's real brain.

    mic -> WakeWordGate("Hey Jarvis") -> HalfDuplexGate -> Deepgram STT
        -> JarvisBrain (own LLM + personality + memory + tools) -> ElevenLabs TTS -> speaker

It responds only after a wake word, ignores ambient speech / its own playback, reasons as
Jarvis using his memory, and can consult the OpenClaw fleet as a tool (once authorized).
