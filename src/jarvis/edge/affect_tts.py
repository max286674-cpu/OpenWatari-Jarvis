"""C3 (edge) — mood-adaptive voice on the LIVE path.

The brain already adapts Watari's WORDING to the owner's affect, and the Telegram voice path adapts his
prosody. This closes the loop on the live mic/AirPods path: it reads each owner utterance, infers affect,
and nudges the ElevenLabs voice (stability/style/speed) so Watari SOUNDS steadier when you're stressed,
gentler when tired, livelier when you're upbeat — before he speaks the reply.

Mechanism: on a ``TranscriptionFrame`` it pushes a ``TTSUpdateSettingsFrame`` downstream (through the
brain, which ignores it) to the TTS service, which applies it to the next utterance. Only re-sends when
the settings actually change, so it's near-silent. Import-light + fail-quiet — voice must never break.

ponytail: the affect→settings numbers live in ``brain.affect.affect_to_voice`` (one source of truth,
already unit-tested); this processor is just the edge wire + a change-filter. Calibrate by ear.
