"""Edge reflexes (subsystem #24) — answer truly-local turns without a brain round-trip.

Some turns need NOTHING external: "what time is it", "what's the date". Routing them to the VPS brain
pays a full WS hop + LLM TTFT for an answer the edge already holds. A ``ReflexGate`` placed right before
the brain (after speaker-verification + affect) catches these, speaks the answer locally, and consumes
the transcript so the brain never runs. Everything else passes straight through — the matcher is
deliberately high-precision (full-string anchored) so it NEVER swallows a turn that needs the brain
("what time does the pharmacy close", "what time is it in Tokyo" → both need data, both fall through).

Scope is intentionally tiny: read-NOW queries that need no external data (time / date / day). "set a
timer" is NOT a reflex — you don't wait on its answer, so its round-trip isn't latency-critical, and it
needs real scheduler machinery the brain already owns. "stop"/"louder" are handled by barge-in / the OS.
Add a reflex here only when it's both instant-answerable locally AND latency-critical.

ponytail: the "sir" honorific mirrors the edge's other hardcoded persona strings (brain_bridge.py); if
the persona is ever made configurable, thread it through here too.
