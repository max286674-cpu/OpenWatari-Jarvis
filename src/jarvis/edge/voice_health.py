"""Cloud voice (Deepgram STT + ElevenLabs TTS) health + automatic local failover.

Policy the owner asked for: **cloud is the PRIMARY route** (accuracy/latency); Whisper + Piper are
LOCAL fallbacks that AUTOMATICALLY take over when the cloud fails, and hand back to cloud once it
recovers. Two independent signals drive the switch:

  1. **Startup probe** — every time the edge starts, a quick REST call checks that Deepgram and
     ElevenLabs actually answer with a valid key. If not (network down / key bad / service down),
     the edge builds the LOCAL engine instead, so it always comes up able to hear and speak.

  2. **Runtime error counter** — the cloud STT/TTS services (subclassed in stt.py/tts.py) call
     ``record_cloud_error`` whenever pipecat escalates a failure (the WebSocket handshake/keepalive
     deaths that a REST probe can't see). When too many land in a short window, the audio watchdog
     trips a restart; a cooldown marker keeps the restart on LOCAL for a while so a genuinely flaky
     cloud doesn't flap back every minute. Once the cooldown lapses and the cloud answers again, the
     watchdog upgrades back to cloud on the next restart.

Stdlib only (urllib) — no new dependency for a health check.
