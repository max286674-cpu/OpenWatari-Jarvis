"""Phase 1.2 — acoustic echo cancellation seam: full-duplex barge-in on OPEN speakers.

On headphones the mic can't hear Watari, so barge-in is already on (see ``device_profile``). On open
speakers the mic re-hears his own TTS and VAD would flag it as the user speaking — so barge-in is forced
OFF and the pipeline runs half-duplex (``HalfDuplexGate`` mutes the mic while he talks). The real fix for
open speakers is an echo-canceller on the mic input that removes Watari's own voice BEFORE VAD sees it.

Pipecat's ``audio_in_filter`` accepts a ``BaseAudioFilter``. The only filters that actually CANCEL ECHO
(not merely suppress noise) are the deep-learning single-channel cancellers — Krisp Viva and ai-coustics —
and both ship as PROPRIETARY, license-gated SDKs (``krisp_audio`` / ``aic_sdk``). So this module is the
integration seam: pick one with ``JARVIS_AEC_FILTER``, and once its SDK is installed the filter builds,
is wired onto the mic, and ``resolve_barge_in`` flips open speakers to full-duplex automatically. Without
the SDK it degrades to None (half-duplex, unchanged) — never a crash.

``rnnoise`` is deliberately NOT offered here: it suppresses noise, not echo, so enabling full-duplex
behind it would just make Watari interrupt himself on his own voice.

ponytail: the working echo MODEL is a paid dependency I can't bundle (like a Home-Assistant hub token) —
the wiring is complete; installing the SDK + ``JARVIS_AEC_FILTER=krisp`` is the one manual step. If a
faint residual echo still trips VAD on very loud speakers, tune the canceller's own residual threshold in
its SDK config (a physical-coupling knob a code default can't see).
