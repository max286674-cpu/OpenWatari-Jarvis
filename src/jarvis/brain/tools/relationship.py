"""Owner-facing tools for relationship memory (Phase 6.2).

Let the owner shape how Watari relates to him: mark a topic as sensitive ("that's a sore subject"),
record a running joke, or ask where they stand. Mood-over-time is logged automatically each turn by the
affect reader — these tools cover the parts only the owner can declare.
