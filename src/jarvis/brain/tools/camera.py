"""Phase 3.2 / 3.3 — Perception: the laptop camera as Watari's eye.

* ``look_around`` (3.2): grab a webcam frame and have a vision model answer about it — "what am I
  looking at", "is the whiteboard readable", "what's in front of me". Reuses ``LLMClient.see``.
* ``visual_presence`` (3.3): grab a frame and count faces LOCALLY with OpenCV's haar cascade — no
  cloud, and the image never leaves the machine (only a yes/no + count) — so Watari can be
  presence-aware (greet when the owner sits down, hold non-urgent nudges when the seat is empty).

Both degrade cleanly: no webcam / camera busy / access blocked → a calm spoken line, never a crash.
The heavy, blocking OpenCV calls run in a thread so the event loop keeps breathing.
