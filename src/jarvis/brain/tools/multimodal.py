"""T6 multi-modal tools — laptop-side screenshot + OCR (precursor to glasses camera + display).

For "what's on my screen" / "read this menu" / "what does this say" queries. Takes a fresh
screenshot of the laptop display via the pc_agent executor and (if pytesseract is installed)
runs OCR on it. Falls back to returning the screenshot path so a vision-capable LLM can read
it on the next turn.

The realised "eyes" (Phase 3): this module SEES the SCREEN (screenshot -> ``describe_screen`` VLM /
``read_screen_text`` OCR); ``tools/camera.py`` sees the ROOM (laptop/phone webcam -> ``look_around``
VLM + ``visual_presence`` local face detection). MentraOS glasses were NOT pursued (no SDK/account —
the half-finished client was deleted); the phone camera is the mobile eye and reuses the same
``LLMClient.see`` surface, so nothing here has to change if a wearable ever lands.
