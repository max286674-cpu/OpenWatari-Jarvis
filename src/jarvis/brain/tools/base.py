"""Shared helpers for Jarvis's Phase 3 tools.

Every tool follows one rule: **never crash the brain on a missing integration**. If a
tool's credentials aren't set, its handler returns a short, plain-English note (via
``not_configured``) that Jarvis simply re-voices to the owner ("Web search isn't wired up
yet, sir — you'd need to add a Tavily key"). Errors are caught and returned the same way
(``tool_error``). Handlers therefore always return a ``str`` the LLM can speak.
