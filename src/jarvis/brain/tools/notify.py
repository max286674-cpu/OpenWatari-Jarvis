"""Push notifications via ntfy — reach Vazghen when voice isn't available.

When Jarvis can't speak (PC asleep, he's away from the mic), a reminder or alert is pushed to
his phone via an ntfy topic (https://ntfy.sh or a self-hosted server). Configure
``JARVIS_NTFY_TOPIC`` (and optionally ``JARVIS_NTFY_SERVER``). Used both as a tool and by the
proactive scheduler's delivery fallback (see ``brain/scheduler.py``).
