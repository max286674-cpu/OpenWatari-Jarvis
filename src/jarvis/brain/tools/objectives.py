"""Multi-day objective tools (Phase 4.1) — hand Watari a goal to DRIVE across days, and check on it.

Voice access to the objective book (``brain/objectives.py``):
  * ``assign_objective``   — "take this on: get Party Map launch-ready" -> Watari owns + advances it daily
  * ``list_objectives``    — "what are you working on?" -> active objectives + their latest progress
  * ``objective_status``   — "how's the Party Map objective going?" -> latest progress + any approvals owed
  * ``complete_objective`` / ``drop_objective`` — mark one done / stop driving it

The autonomous daily advance (bounded worker, outward steps deferred) runs via the scheduler; these just
let the owner manage the list. Fail-quiet.
