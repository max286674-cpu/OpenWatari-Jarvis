"""Play music INTO a Telegram group voice chat — so your PHONE actually hears it live.

This is the one honest way to make music play *through Telegram on your phone*: Jarvis (your user
account, via **pytgcalls**) joins the voice chat of the "Jarvis Music Room" group and streams the
track into it. You join that voice chat once on your phone and leave it open; every track Jarvis
streams then plays live in your ear. (A *bot* cannot do this — only a user account can join a
Telegram voice chat, which is why this uses your Telethon session, not the bot token.)

A persistent pytgcalls client is held as a singleton (like the browser/local player). It uses a
**separate copy** of the authorized Telethon session so its long-lived connection never locks the
short-lived clients the other Telegram tools use.
