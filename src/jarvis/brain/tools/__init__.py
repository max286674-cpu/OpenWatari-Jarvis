"""Jarvis's Phase 3 tool registry — knowledge & channels.

Each tool module exposes ``SCHEMAS`` (OpenAI function schemas the LLM sees) and ``HANDLERS``
(name -> async ``handler(args: dict) -> str``). The agent merges these with its built-ins
(get_time, delegate_to_fleet). Every handler degrades gracefully when its integration isn't
configured, so the full set can always be registered safely (see ``tools/base.py``).

Adding a capability = drop a module here and list it in ``_MODULES``.
