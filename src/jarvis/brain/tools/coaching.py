"""Coaching tools (Phase 2 companion) — Watari as a coach for the fields you focus on.

The owner asked for e.g. an evening German check at his current level, with progress tracked over
time. The QUIZ is conducted conversationally by the agent (it's good at that); these tools give it
the state it needs and let it record the outcome:

  * ``start_skill_check`` — begin a review: returns the current level + an instruction for the agent
    to run a short, level-appropriate check one question at a time, then call record_skill_review;
  * ``record_skill_review`` — log a 1-10 score + note (updates streak/trend);
  * ``skill_progress`` — report level, recent average, trend, streak;
  * ``set_skill_level`` — set/correct the level;
  * ``list_skills`` — the fields being coached.

All local + persisted (brain/coaching.py). Degrade to plain notes; never raise.
