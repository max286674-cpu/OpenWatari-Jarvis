"""Activity / screen-time tools (Phase 0 companion).

Voice access to what the presence layer (``brain/presence.py``) has been observing on the laptop:
  * ``screen_time`` — how long you've spent, by app/category, today or a past day;
  * ``current_activity`` — what you're doing right this second (context);
  * ``activity_tracking`` — the privacy off-switch (status / pause / resume).

All local; nothing leaves the machine. Degrades to a plain note if no laptop is attached / no samples.
