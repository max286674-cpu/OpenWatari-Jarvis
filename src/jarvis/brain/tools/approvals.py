"""Approval-queue tools (Phase 4.2) — the human in the loop for autonomous work.

When Watari works unattended he refuses outward/destructive steps and QUEUES them. These tools let the
owner clear that queue by voice:
  * ``list_approvals``  — "what needs my approval?"
  * ``approve_action``  — "approve the first one" / "approve the email" -> executes it NOW
  * ``reject_action``   — "no, drop that one"

Approving runs the exact tool + args the worker wanted, with the owner's consent supplied at that moment.
