"""Graph-memory tools (L5b) — structured, multi-hop associative recall over the entity graph.

These sit in a LAZY tool group ("graph"): they only join the per-turn surface when the owner talks
about connections between things ("what's related to…", "link X to Y"). Free-text remember/recall
stays core; this is the deliberate, structured layer on top. Backed by ``brain/graph.py`` (no-server
sqlite triple store) — see that module's header for why this is lean rather than Neo4j.
