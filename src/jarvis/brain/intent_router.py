"""B1 — intent→forced-tool router (Workstream 0, the benchmark's biggest lever).

The non-thinking primary (MiniMax-Text-01) mis-selects tools: asked for the calendar it fires
``get_time``; asked for unread Telegram it fabricates "you have 5". Forcing ``tool_choice=required``
alone doesn't help — with the whole tool surface advertised the model still picks the wrong one.

The fix is to *narrow* the advertised tools to the ONE tool a high-precision intent needs, then force
``required``. With a single tool on the table and a forced call, the model physically cannot answer
with ``get_time`` or invent a number.

``forced_tools(text)`` returns the tool name(s) to narrow to (``[]`` = no narrowing, normal lazy-group
behaviour). The caller SKIPS this on multi-intent turns (compound requests need the full surface and are
handled by the completion loop). First matching route wins, so order below == priority.

Canonical "my task list" = **Notion** (``notion_tasks``), not the local queue: the owner's whole
workflow is Notion-centric and the behavioural suite expects it. The local queue stays for explicitly
reminder-framed phrasing ("my reminders"), which routes elsewhere.
