"""Self-health — Jarvis notices when his own organs are failing and says so (Phase X).

A great assistant knows when he's degraded. This module checks the parts Jarvis depends on — the L3
Obsidian vault (must always be readable), the L4 cache backend, and the always-on VPS ticker (if
configured) — and exposes two faces:

  * ``check()`` — a structured snapshot for the ``self_health`` tool ("are you all right?").
  * ``health_signals()`` — a proactive signal source: it emits a Signal *only when something is
    actually wrong*, so the tick can surface "I've lost sight of your vault, sir" unprompted (then
    repeat-suppression keeps it from nagging).

Everything is fail-quiet: a check that itself errors is reported as a degraded component, never a
crash.
