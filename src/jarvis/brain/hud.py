"""Phase 5.3 — the ambient HUD: one live snapshot of what Watari is holding for you.

A read-only status surface — objectives he's driving, what he's working on right now, anything waiting
on your approval, and where your attention is — served as JSON at ``/hud.json`` and rendered by
``clients/hud/index.html``. It only READS the same singletons the brain already runs on, so it can never
perturb a live turn. Every section is fail-quiet: a broken source yields an empty section, never a 500.

ponytail: no new datastore — this is a projection of OBJECTIVES / TASKS / APPROVALS / PRESENCE. The page
polls this endpoint on an interval; there's no push channel here (add SSE only if a few-second lag ever bites).
