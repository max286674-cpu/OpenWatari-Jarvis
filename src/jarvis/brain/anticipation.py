"""Phase 2.3 — reasoned anticipation.

The old ``pattern_suggestion`` matched keyword regexes ("you mention lofi around 20:00"). JARVIS
anticipates by *reasoning*: given everything he knows about what the owner is trying to do and what
just happened, is there ONE genuinely useful, non-obvious, timely thing to say right now? This is a
proactive ``SignalSource`` that renders the world-model (Phase 2.1) + recent activity into a prompt
and asks the LLM exactly that — returning at most one Signal, or none.

Two guards keep it cheap and calm:
  * an **interval gate** so it reasons at most once every ``min_interval_s`` (it's wired into a tick
    that may run every few minutes; an LLM call per tick would be wasteful) — the O1/efficiency knob;
  * it must answer ``NONE`` unless something clears the bar, and the engine's own budget +
    repeat-suppression (keyed on the message) stop it from nagging.

Everything is injectable (llm / world / clock / recent) so the whole thing is hermetically testable
with a fake LLM, and every failure is swallowed — a thrown source is just skipped by the tick.
