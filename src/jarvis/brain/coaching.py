"""Field coaching store (Phase 2 companion) — Watari tracks your progress in the fields you focus on.

The owner has standing focus areas (the vault CHARTERs: language-learning, training-diet-health,
coding-projects, …). This is the persistence + logic behind Watari acting as a coach for the
*skill* ones: he remembers your current LEVEL (e.g. German "B1"), logs each review with a 1-10
score + note, tracks a daily STREAK and a trend, and knows when a field is due for a check-in. The
actual quiz/review is conducted conversationally by the agent (LLMs are good at that) — this module
just holds the state and the "is it time?" logic, so it's deterministic and testable.

SQLite-backed (survives restarts), fail-quiet, local-only.
