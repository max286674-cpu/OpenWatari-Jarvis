"""Proactive scheduler — the engine behind reminders and timed/recurring nudges (Phase 4).

A single process-wide ``SCHEDULER`` (APScheduler ``AsyncIOScheduler``) persisted to SQLite, so
reminders survive a restart. When a job fires it calls the module-level coroutine ``_fire`` (a
top-level function so APScheduler can serialize the reference), which delivers the message two
ways: it **speaks** it through the live edge callback if Jarvis is running, and **pushes** it
to the phone via ntfy. Either path is best-effort.

Triggers supported by ``add_reminder``: a one-shot delay (``in_minutes``), an absolute time
(``at`` ISO-8601), or a daily time (``daily`` 'HH:MM').
