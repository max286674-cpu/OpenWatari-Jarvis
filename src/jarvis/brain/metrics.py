"""Lightweight process metrics — structured observability without a heavy stack (TODO 8.8).

A single-user voice assistant doesn't need Prometheus + Grafana. This is a tiny in-process registry
of counters + rolling latency summaries that the brain exposes as JSON at ``GET /metrics`` (auth-
gated). It answers the questions that actually matter for THIS system: how many turns has it served,
how many tool calls / errors, how often the LLM chain fails over, what the recent TTFW looks like,
and how long it's been up.

Zero dependencies, thread-safe (a lock around dict mutations, since the HTTP handler reads from a
different thread than the async agent writes). ``snapshot()`` is a plain dict → ``json.dumps``.

ponytail: in-memory only. Metrics reset on restart — that's fine for a single always-on process; if
you ever need history, scrape /metrics into a time-series DB externally rather than growing this.
