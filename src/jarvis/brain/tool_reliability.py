"""Tool-reliability learning — Watari learns which of his own tools have been flaky lately (Tools-util).

The audit log (``audit.py``) already records every tool call with an ``ok`` flag, one JSON line per
call across daily files. This reads that trail back and aggregates a per-tool success rate over a recent
window, so the assistant can *learn from its own behaviour* instead of treating every tool as equally
trustworthy every time:

  * ``reliability(days)`` — {tool: {calls, failures, rate}} over the last ``days`` of audit files.
  * ``flaky_note()`` — a per-turn system note naming tools that have been unreliable *recently* (enough
    calls to matter, low success rate), so the model sets expectations / prefers an alternative. ``None``
    when everything's healthy — like ``manner_note``, silent unless there's something to say. Cached with a
    short TTL so it costs one file-scan every few minutes, not one per turn.
  * ``reliability_summary()`` — the worst offenders, for the ambient HUD.

ponytail: no new datastore — this is a read-only projection of the audit jsonl the brain already writes.
The window is small (7 days) and files are one-per-day, so a scan is cheap; the TTL cache makes the
per-turn path effectively free.
