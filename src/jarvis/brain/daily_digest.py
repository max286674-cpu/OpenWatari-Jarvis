"""One daily catch-up: past-due tasks + important unread email, delivered ONCE per channel/day.

Replaces the old per-tick task/email proactive nudges. Those were keyed per-day but only
repeat-suppressed for ``proactive_repeat_suppress_minutes`` (120 min) and reset on every brain
restart, so the SAME two lines ("N past-due tasks", "M important emails") got pushed to Telegram
3-4 times each — the 7-8 duplicate messages the owner was seeing every day.

Now that information is a single consolidated digest delivered on at most two channels per local day:
  * ``"push"`` — the timed morning briefing (06:00 by default), reaching the phone via a Telegram
    voice-note / ntfy push even with the PC off;
  * ``"edge"`` — appended to the owner's FIRST live-edge turn of the day ("By the way, sir — …"),
    so it's heard conversationally the moment he starts talking.

A tiny JSON state file records which channel already delivered on which date, so neither channel
repeats within a day and a brain restart never re-fires it. Every source is fail-quiet: a broken
Notion/Gmail call just drops that part of the digest, never raises.
