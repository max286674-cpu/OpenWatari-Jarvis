"""Self-improvement loop — adapted from NousResearch/hermes-agent's ``background_review``.

Hermes, after a turn, forks the agent to replay the conversation and ask itself "should anything be
saved to memory?", writing straight to its memory store while the main conversation + prompt cache
stay untouched. We apply the same idea to Watari's brain: a background pass replays the recent
conversation and asks the model what DURABLE facts about the owner are worth remembering long-term,
then writes them to **L1 learned memory** (``STORE.remember``, which dedups).

Why it matters here: Watari's 5-layer memory was elaborate but EMPTY (L1 = 0 facts) because nothing
ever wrote to it. This loop is what makes the memory actually learn as you talk — and it runs OFF
the hot path (a separate task) so it never slows a reply.

Invariants (mirroring Hermes): only ADD/dedup, never delete here; never touch the live conversation
or the main model's prompt; degrade silently on any error.
