"""Code self-improvement (4.12) — Watari improves his OWN source, bounded and branch-only.

This is the controlled version of "the assistant edits itself": a bounded worker loop that, on a
FRESH branch, reads the relevant source, makes a minimal change, runs the test suite, and — only if
green — commits locally. It NEVER pushes. The push to GitHub stays a human decision; this loop hands
back a branch for the owner to review and approve.

Guard rails (why this is safe to have at all):
  * OFF by default (``settings.code_self_improve_enabled``). It edits real code, so it only runs when
    explicitly armed for a deploy. When off, calling it is a no-op that says so.
  * Branch-only. The orchestrator creates the branch itself before the model does anything, so edits
    never land on the working branch. ``git_push`` and ``create_github_issue`` are not even in the
    tool set handed to the model, and they aren't in the pre-authorised set — so a push attempt
    DEFERS (it can never happen autonomously).
  * Bounded. A hard step budget (``code_self_improve_max_steps``); then it must write a result.
  * Tests are the gate. The system prompt mandates run_tests before any commit, and revert on red.

ponytail: this reuses ``TaskWorker`` rather than growing a second agent loop. The only new machinery
is the branch bootstrap + a coding-only tool set + a pre-authorised write/commit allowlist.
