"""Conflict-only interventions (Phase 4) — the one time Watari deliberately INTERRUPTS.

Every other proactive behaviour steps back when the owner is busy (Phase 1 holds routine nudges while
he's watching something). This is the single, narrow exception the owner asked for: if he's absorbed
in MEDIA *and* a real, timed commitment is about to start, Watari pauses the media and flags the
concrete conflict — "you've got the dentist in 10 minutes and you're mid-episode; head off, or keep
watching?". One clear question, one-word dismissible, and it rides the SAME dismissal-learning as any
other kind (kind ``conflict``), so if the owner keeps waving it off it backs off on its own.

Deliberately conservative — this only ever fires on a *named calendar event within the lead window
while media is actually playing*. No event, no media, not logged in, or tracking paused => nothing.
It is OFF by default (``interventions_enabled``); the owner arms it once he trusts the rest.

The intervention's side-effect (pausing the media) travels on the Signal's ``action``, which the
proactive engine runs only when it actually interjects — so the spoken "I've paused it" is truthful.
