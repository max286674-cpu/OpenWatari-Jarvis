"""Phase 6.1 — affect sensing: read the owner's state and adapt Watari's manner.

Heuristic and on the hot path (no LLM call, no audio): infer stress / tiredness / low mood / good spirits /
curtness from the utterance TEXT plus cheap context (the small hours). Returns a compact ``Affect`` and a
one-line manner directive that rides the turn as a system note — concise and calm when he's frustrated,
gentle when he's flat, out of the way when he's neutral.

ponytail: a keyword+context heuristic, NOT a voice-emotion model. It reads text (post-STT), so real
prosody (tone, pace, a sigh) is invisible — the upgrade path is a speech-emotion model at the edge feeding
an ``affect_hint`` alongside the transcript. Calibrate the cue lists to how the owner actually talks.
