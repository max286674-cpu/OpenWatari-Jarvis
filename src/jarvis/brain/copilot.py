"""Task co-pilot (Phase 3) — Watari plans a task WITH the owner, then executes it for him.

The to-do tools (tools/tasks.py) let the owner capture and track tasks. This module is the next
step up: turning a captured task into WORK. The loop the owner asked for is

    clarify  ->  plan  ->  confirm  ->  execute (worker / fleet)  ->  report

  * **clarify + plan** (``build_plan``): a single bounded LLM call turns a task title+description
    into a concrete plan — clarifying questions (only if it's genuinely underspecified), an ordered
    list of steps, which of those steps are OUTWARD (need the owner's approval), and a recommendation
    of who should do it: Watari himself (the bounded worker) or the OpenClaw fleet (deep domain work).
    This is the "dry-run": it shows the plan without doing anything.
  * **confirm**: the plan is spoken back and the owner says go (or answers the questions first).
  * **execute**: handed to the ``TaskWorker`` (safe research/draft/code, DEFERS every outward step)
    or delegated to the fleet — in the BACKGROUND, linked back to the to-do so its progress updates.
  * **report**: completion is announced by voice via the TaskQueue, as with any background job.

The defer-outward invariant stays sacred: execution never sends/deletes/pushes unattended — those
steps are always listed back for approval. This module is pure logic (an injected ``llm``), so the
whole plan/parse/executor-choice path is hermetically testable with a fake LLM.
