"""User behaviour pattern recognition.

Watari logs every command's topic + timestamp, and on a daily cron (see ``scheduler.py``) it
scans the rolling log for repeating patterns: same time-of-day on N consecutive days, same
day-of-week on N consecutive weeks, or a topic the user asks about >=3 times a week. When a
pattern is detected it's durably written as an L1 fact so the proactive engine and the LLM
can recall it.

Patterns are intentionally coarse — daily human behaviour has plenty of noise, and a false
positive ("user plays Mr Blue Sky on Fridays") is forgivable since the owner can `forget`
the bad fact. Over-detecting is the right default.
