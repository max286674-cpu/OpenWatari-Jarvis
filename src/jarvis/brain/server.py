"""jarvis-brain WebSocket server — hosts ``JarvisAgent`` over ``shared/protocol.py``.

This is the brain endpoint the ``BrainBridge`` comment promises: a remote client (the
iPhone web client in ``clients/iphone/``, the Mentra glasses bridge, or the laptop edge)
connects over WebSocket, sends ``Hello`` + ``Utterance``, and receives streamed
``StreamEvent`` reply chunks for incremental TTS.

ONE shared ``JarvisAgent`` backs every connection, so all four devices talk to the SAME
brain + memory (the "same brain/session from phone and glasses" acceptance criterion).
Turns are serialised with a lock so a phone turn and a glasses turn can't interleave the
agent's history. A new utterance (or an explicit ``Barge``) cancels the session's in-flight
turn so Jarvis stops talking and listens.

Run it (also serves the phone client over HTTP)::

    uv run python -m jarvis.brain.server

For a phone on the same Wi-Fi, bind to all interfaces: ``JARVIS_BRAIN_HOST=0.0.0.0``.
