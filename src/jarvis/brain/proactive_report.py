"""Proactive action reports — when Watari does something UNPROMPTED, he says so, and explains why.

The autonomous drivers (backlog pass, objectives advance, …) take real actions on the owner's behalf —
e.g. commenting drafted work onto his Notion tasks. Silently is not enough: the owner asked to be told
WHAT was done, WHY (the trigger), and Watari's brief reasoning/chain of thought. This turns a batch of
actions into one short spoken report, delivered through the normal proactive path (listening edge →
Telegram voice note → ntfy push) by the caller.

One bounded LLM call produces the chain-of-thought prose from the REAL actions (no invention); a
deterministic fallback keeps the report honest and never-silent if the model is unavailable. ``llm`` is
injectable so the logic is testable without a real model.
