"""Phase 10 — the proactive engine: Jarvis decides when to speak *unprompted*.

The owner's ask, verbatim: proactivity means Jarvis can remind, pause, ask for context, re-ask /
confirm, interrupt, and *start speaking on his own* when he judges it helpful. This module is the
"start speaking on his own" brain: a background **tick** that, on an interval, gathers signals,
asks "is anything worth saying right now, and how urgent?", and acts — but inside a strict
**interruption budget** and **quiet hours**, so he's a companion, not a nag.

Design goals:
  * **Decoupled + testable.** The decision core (budget, quiet hours, relevance threshold,
    repeat-suppression, day rollover) is pure and driven by an injectable clock + signal sources,
    so the whole policy is verified offline with no mic, no network, no real time passing.
  * **Fail-quiet.** A broken signal source or emit channel never throws into the tick loop; worst
    case Jarvis simply stays silent.
  * **Two channels.** If a device is listening, an interjection is *spoken* (interrupt). If not, it
    falls back to an ntfy push so it still reaches his phone. Routine-grade signals stay silent in
    quiet hours; only a near-emergency (>= quiet_override) gets through then, and only as a push.

The clarify/confirm verbs live alongside as small policy helpers (`needs_clarification`,
`confirm_required`) the agent loop and persona use before acting on ambiguous or consequential
requests.
