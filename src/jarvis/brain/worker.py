"""TaskWorker — a bounded autonomous work loop (Phase 4.1).

`delegate_to_fleet` hands work to the OpenClaw team; this is Watari doing focused work HIMSELF: a
small, bounded tool loop for research, drafting, summarising, light coding, and verification, using
the tools he already has (web/scrape/vault/Notion/coding/utilities). It is deliberately NOT the live
conversation loop:

  * It runs to a step budget and then must produce a written result — it can't loop forever.
  * It is SAFE by construction: any confirm-gated / outward-facing / destructive tool (send_email,
    file delete, run_powershell, push, …) is NOT executed here. There is no human in the loop to say
    "yes" mid-background-task, so such a step is DEFERRED — recorded and handed back for the owner to
    approve. The worker still does all the safe research/draft work around it.
  * It holds no conversation history and no shared agent state, so it's safe to run in the background
    (via the TaskQueue) alongside live turns, and is hermetically testable with a fake LLM.
