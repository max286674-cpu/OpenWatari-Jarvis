# Watari — Voice Recognition Read-Aloud Script (≈ 3 minutes)

**Purpose:** read this aloud once to (a) enroll your voiceprint for speaker biometrics and
(b) calibrate speech-to-text. Read at a natural, unhurried pace — about 140 words per minute.
Sit where you normally talk to Watari, with your usual mic. Don't perform; speak the way you
actually speak. The script is ~430 words and is built to cover a wide range of sounds, numbers,
names, and intonations so the voiceprint is robust.

**How to use it:**
1. `uv sync --extra identity` (one-time, installs the ECAPA backend and microphone capture).
2. `uv run python bench/enroll_voice.py --script "to-read-script.md"` and read each prompted
   block when it says *recording*. (Plain `enroll_voice.py` still works for a quick 12-second
   enrollment; the script gives a stronger profile.)
3. When it finishes, set `JARVIS_SPEAKER_ID_ENABLED=true` in `.env`.

Pauses are marked with `…` — take a real breath there.
